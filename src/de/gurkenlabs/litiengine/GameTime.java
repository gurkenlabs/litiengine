 * The {@code GameTime} class provides temporal information that can be used to perform time based events.

 * <p>
 * The time provided by this class is measured in (game loop) ticks which is essentially an iteration of the game's main update loop.

 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Examples</b><br>
 * A common use-case is to track the passed time since a certain event occurred (e.g. some action was performed by an {@code Entity}).<br>
 * Another example is an environment that has a time limit.
