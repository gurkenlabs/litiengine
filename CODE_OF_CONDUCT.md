## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a grief-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression,
level of experience, education, socio-economic status, political orientation, nationality, 
appearance, race, religion, or sexual characteristics and identity.

## Weapons Policy

No weapons will be allowed at LITIengine events, community spaces, or in other spaces covered by the scope of this Code of Conduct. 
Weapons include but are not limited to guns, explosives (including fireworks), and large knives such as those used for hunting or display, as well as any other item used for the purpose of causing injury or harm to others. 
Anyone seen in possession of one of these items will be asked to leave immediately, and will only be allowed to return without the weapon. 
Community members are further expected to comply with all state and local laws on this matter.

## Our Responsibilities

The project maintainers Steffen Wilke and Matthias Wilke are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Moderators can be appointed by the project maintainers to monitor and moderate activities in the community.
Project maintainers and moderators have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem unacceptable by the standards of this code of conduct.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors, project maintainers, moderators, and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.
Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at info@gurkenlabs.de. 
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated by project maintainers and moderators and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers and moderators who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.

## Reporting violations

or responsible community managers and include at least the following information:
