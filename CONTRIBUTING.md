## How do I contribute?
* Create a Github account
* Fork the LITIengine repository
* Create a thematically labelled branch
* Commit & Push your changes to the branch
  * Commits should be logical and atomic units. Commit often!
  * We expect any new methods that you write to be fully documented
  * Make sure to also include unit tests for new features
  * Clean up your code following our style and formatting guide (Which we don't have ready yet. Heh.)
* File a Pull Request
  * We try to review pull requests as often as possible, but don't be mad if it takes us some days before reviewing yours.
  * As soon as your changes were reviewed and approved, we will merge them into the master branch.
  * Due to questionable design decisions, violations of our code of conduct, or bugs, we may reject pull requests. Again, this is nothing to be mad about: After you've revised the questionable portions of your pull request, we'll happily review it once more.
  * Changes resulting in build and test pipeline failures that cannot be resolved within two days will be reverted.
  
  If you want to help in other ways, like hosting workshops or becoming a community moderator, just contact us at info@litiengine.com to specify the details.
