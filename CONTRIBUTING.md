### Nothing of the above applies to you?
Well... if you still want to support us, you could consider helping us bear the development costs for LITIENGINE (e.g. servers and equipment).
You can do so by sponsoring [LITIENGINE on OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/litiengine) or sponsoring the devs [Steffen](https://github.com/sponsors/steffen-wilke) and [Matthias](https://github.com/sponsors/nightm4re94) directly on GitHub.

## Code contributions
### Setting up your development environment
* [Install JDK 21](https://litiengine.com/docs/getting-started/install-jdk/)
* [Clone the LITIENGINE repository](https://github.com/gurkenlabs/litiengine.git)
* Open the LITIENGINE project in [your IDE of choice](https://litiengine.com/docs/getting-started/development-environment/)
* Make sure that the project is imported as a Gradle project
* Make sure that the project is compiled with JDK 21 and that JDK 21 is also set as your Gradle runtime
* Use Gradle to build the project. You can do this via the UI, or open a terminal in the project's root folder and type `./gradlew build`.
* If the build was successful, you have now completed all steps required for contributing to LITIENGINE development. Continue with the next section.
* Having any trouble? Ask for help in the [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/gurkenlabs/litiengine/discussions) or on our [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/rRB9cKD).

### Submitting code contributions
* Create a GitHub account
* Fork the [LITIENGINE repository](https://github.com/gurkenlabs/litiengine)
* Create a thematically labelled branch
* Commit & Push your changes to the branch
  * Commits should be logical and atomic units. Commit often!
  * We expect any new methods that you write to be fully documented
  * Make sure to also include unit tests for new features
  * Clean up your code following our style guide below.
* File a Pull Request
  * We try to review pull requests as often as possible, but don't be mad if it takes us some days before reviewing yours.
  * As soon as your changes were reviewed and approved, we will merge them into the main branch.
  * Due to questionable design decisions, violations of our code of conduct, or bugs, we may reject pull requests and ask for changes. Again, this is nothing to be mad about: After you've revised the defective portions of your pull request, we'll happily review it once more.
  * Changes resulting in build and test pipeline failures that cannot be resolved within two days will be reverted.

### Style Guide
Code in the LITIENGINE repository needs to be formatted in compliance with the **gurkenlabs Java code style**. You can use the configuration file provided in [`config/gurkenlabs.eclipseformat.xml`](config/gurkenlabs.eclipseformat.xml).
The configuration can be imported for automatic formatting in Eclipse (`Window -> Preferences -> Java -> Code Style -> Formatter`) and IntelliJ (`File → Settings → Editor → Code Style`).
To ensure compliance with our code style when raising Pull Requests, use the provided Gradle tasks `spotlessCheck`, `spotlessApply`, and `spotlessDiagnose`.
