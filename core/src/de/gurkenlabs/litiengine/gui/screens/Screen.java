 * Screens are the containers that allow you to organize the visible contents of your game. They
 * render the game’s Environment and are considered the parent of all GUI components you want to
 * display in a particular state of your game. The screen itself inherits from GuiComponent and
 * thereby provides support to define an Appearance and listen to all kinds of Input events (e.g.
 * {@code onMouseMoved(…)}). Everything that should be visible to the player needs to be rendered to
 * the currently active screen.
